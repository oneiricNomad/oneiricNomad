- 👋 Hi, I’m @oneiricNomad ! It's very nice to meet you!
- 👀 I’m interested in programing for the Pocket C.H.I.P. and for Linux Debian.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create and manage a server as a Linux SysAdmin, as practice for my future career in IT!
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating with you on all sorts of things!
- 📫 How to reach me: oneiricNomad [ON]#6677  +1(405)201-5275
- 💻 Please be patient with me if I don't do much right now... I set my collaberation input method to Command Line Interface, and my only good computer is a school MacBook that has the Terminal blocked, and i forgot how to change my input method.
